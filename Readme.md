------------------------------------WARNING----------------------------------------
- DELETE EXISTING INSTALLATIONS then delete folders and do a clean install. MANY things have changed; if a part name has changed, I will provide 

1. Add-on is a replica of the rocket from the US lunar program of the 60s of last century.
2. The package includes the Saturn V rocket, the Apollo spacecraft, the lunar module, as well as the rover for the movement and exploration of the moon's surface (Mun)
3. Despite the fact that the add-on is a replica of real apparats, the models do not have 100% accuracy with the real prototype
4. The addon works for versions 1.2.X (LRV not work), 1.3X, 1.4X.

------------------------------------

In VAB, in the search engine type the word "SATURN V", 
you will get all 41 models from the add-on.
