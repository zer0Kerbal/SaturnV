description = The extreme bottom part of the body, a ring-shaped part to connect Aft Interstage is Aft Skirt Assembly. Two set of posture control rockets (Auxiliary propulsion system : APS), two Ullage Rockets, one DC28V battery and one DC56V battery is carried here. APS is was completely independent rocket system with S-IVB. It has an private liquid fuel tank in that, and can be controlled in 3 axis. Ullage Rocket is solid fuel rocket to increase the acceleration to press fuel inside the tank at the bottom. It ignites before J2 engine jetting, and is jettisoned after use.
